# `sicp`

These are my solutions to the exercises in [*Structure and
Interpretation of Computer
Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.

Directories are laid out by chapter (ch1, ch2, etc.)

I have not reproduced the exercises themselves here, you'll need to
find a copy of the cook itself to understand what the exercises are
asking. This was intentional, even though the book is licensed under
the Creative Commons.

If you're reviewing these and find a mistake, feel free to submit an
issue or pull request.
